## Prerequisites

This is a single page web app and requires only static web hosting to deploy the service.

We recommend hosting on your own app platform or service.

## Setup

## Running the sample

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn install`

Installs all the dependencies for the app.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
